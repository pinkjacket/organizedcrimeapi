# _Crimes API_

#### _An API about organized crime, 1/26/2018_

#### By _**James Donlan**_

## Description

_The mafia, the yakuza, the Irish mob, Bratva. Throughout history, powerful groups such as these have risen to control illegal activity in their areas. They're kind of scary but pretty interesting, and with this API you can pull up interesting facts about them any time! From membership numbers to their relationship with local governments, it's all here._

_As someone who takes an interest in the world of organized crime, and therefore knows a lot about it, I thought an API about it would be neat. It's pretty basic right now, but functioning, and I can see building it out to include more variables and classes, like one for specific incidents. After all, what's the point of being able to pull up a profile on Meyer Lansky if you can't read about the time he tried to kill someone by poisoning a chicken and then carrying it around while he figured out how he was going to get them to eat it? (he never quite managed it).

For now there's just organizations and individuals. Individuals get a name and a description and belong to an organization, since this isn't about lone wolves, and organizations get a name, a true name (the mafia don't call themselves the mafia, and the yakuza prefer to be said to be walking "the extreme path"), location, a brief assessment of their current membership, and a brief assessment of their relationship with the local government (while the mafia has been pretty much crushed in America for a while now thanks to RICO statutes, the yakuza are extremely cozy with Japan's conservative government, to say nothing of the corporate world).

Currently it's only set up as far as organizations working properly through Postman, an example of which can be seen here https://imgur.com/a/gxwl1
